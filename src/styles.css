/* My layout is really ugly because I didn't even think to base it all on a template. I was starting CSS from scratch so i was fiddling with the silly details for far too long. By the time I realized I could use a template I was too afraid to redo everything. I'm also partially colour blind so when it comes to colour schemes I either give up or throw whatever wherever as long as it's all legible. I usually just go with all black because of that. */
