# functions
Many of these functions originated in the Underscore.js library, and in recent versions, were moved to be a part of the native JavaScript language. Your task will be to rewrite these functions from scratch.

### Instructions
Write the functions found in `functions.js`. In the comments above each function, there are instructions on what it is supposed to do, as well as example calls to this function with the expected output. Once you have written the function, open up a console in Chrome, copy+paste the function into the console and hit enter. Then, copy+paste the example call, and verify that the output you're receiving in the console is the same as the expected answer.
